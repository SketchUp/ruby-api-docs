<h1 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h1>

<p>The SketchUp API has been around in some fashion since the early days of
SketchUp, and with every release we have extended its capabilities.
Read below for what’s been changed.</p>

<p>Though our adoption rate to the latest version is quite high, it can take time
after a release before everyone upgrades. If you are building scripts that rely
on functionality from the most recent version, be sure to check the
Sketchup.version to make sure your users are able to run your script:</p>

<pre class="code ruby"><code class="ruby"><span class='comment'># You do something like this in the initialization routine of your extension.

<h2 id="whats-new-in-sketchup-2016-m0">What’s new in SketchUp 2016 M0</h2>

<h3 id="a-new-layout-api">A new LayOut API</h3>

<p>We’re proud to announce our first step towards an extension ecosystem for LayOut. Using this new API developers can now open, create, modify, save, and export .layout files. Practically, this means that other applications can import or export the .layout file format using the C API. (This includes creating a .layout file from SketchUp). We have several sample scripts for developers to try out at release. Check out the API documentation in the <a href="http://extensions.sketchup.com/developer_center/layout_c_api/layout/index.html">Developer Center</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="digitally-signing-extensions---extensions-loading-policy">Digitally Signing Extensions - Extensions Loading Policy</h3>

<p>With SketchUp 2016 we introduced the ability for users to select which Extension Loading Policy they want to use. The options are “Identified Extensions Only”, “Approve Unidentified Extensions”, and “Unrestricted.</p>

<p>The developer side of this feature is known as a Digital Signature. All SketchUp extensions for 2016 or later will now require a Digital Signature to run in the highest security mode - “Identified Extensions Only”. If the user has chosen “Approve Unidentified Extensions” then all signed extensions will load automatically and any unsigned extension will have to be approved by the user. All extensions signed and unsigned, will load in “Unrestricted” mode.</p>

<p>SketchUp 2016 M0 installs in “Unrestricted” mode by default.</p>

<p>To digitally sign your extension, simply upload your .rbz package to our new Digital Signature and Encryption page and we will sign it and return it to you. Visit the new <a href="https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer_center/extension_signature">Extension Digital Signature page</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to sign your extension each time you make code changes and want to re-release it. You will need to be a registered Developer on the Extension Warehouse to be able to sign or encrypt extensions. <a href="http://http://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer">Apply here!</a></p>

<h3 id="ruby-encryption-20">Ruby Encryption 2.0</h3>

<p>Goodbye .rbs and Hello .rbe! We have added a new encryption that you can use to help protect your extension Intellectual Property (IP). SketchUp 2016 can read both .rbe and .rbs filetypes. This should help make sure that we maintain backwards compatibility for authors who need some time to re-encrypt their extensions. To use our new encryption, simply upload an unencrypted version of your .rbz package to our new Digital Signature and Encryption page and we will encrypt it and return it to you. Visit the new <a href="https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer_center/extension_signature">Extension Digital Signature page</a> page here for more information.</p>

<p>You will need to be a registered Developer on the Extension Warehouse to be able to sign or encrypt extensions. <a href="http://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer">Apply here!</a></p>

<h3 id="developer-center">Developer Center</h3>

<p>Between the new Extension Digital Signature Page, the new LayOut C API and a whole lot of future ideas and potential, we have decided to create a new central location to organize our developer resources, API documentation, etc. Visit (and bookmark!): <a href="https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer_center">https://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer_center</a></p>

<h3 id="observer-upgrades">Observer Upgrades</h3>

<p>We have been working on finding ways to make observers more stable and reliable for all developers. Most of these changes happen under the hood and are not entirely visible to developers. To help with that, we added a few Ruby Warnings that appear in the Ruby Console, and two debugging methods that will determine whether those warnings are shown: Sketchup.debug_mode= and Sketchup.debug_mode?.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Observer events are now queued up until the active operation is done.</li>
  <li>ModelObserver doesn’t notify about intermediate Ruby operations (“transactions”).</li>
  <li>Observers should no longer return zombie Ruby objects for entities. See the Observers 2016 pdf for more information.</li>
  <li>Removed dummy methods from all observer base classes in order to improve performance.See <a href="https://assets.sketchup.com/files/ewh/Observers2016.pdf">this pdf</a> for a more in depth look at the changes we made to the Observers.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sketchup-c-api-parity---continued">SketchUp C API Parity - continued</h3>

<p>We have focused on adding features to the SketchUp C API in 2016 to provide greater benefit to our developers and as part of our continued effort to fully deprecate and remove the old C++ API in the future. Below is a complete list of functions that we have added for 2016. We are continuing to add more until we gain enough coverage to consider the C API at feature parity with the deprecated C++ API.</p>

<h3 id="new-ruby-api">New Ruby API</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Added optional arguments to Sketchup::View.draw_text which define the appearance of the text drawn.</li>
  <li>Added Axes class, exposing the drawing axes in SketchUp via model.axes and page.axes.</li>
  <li>Added PickHelper.window_pick.</li>
  <li>Added PickHelper.boundingbox_pick.</li>
  <li>Added Sketchup::Texture.write.</li>
  <li>Added Sketchup::ComponentDefinition.count_used_instances</li>
  <li>Added Model.export to export pdf files. This is a vector export, not a rasterized image wrapped up in a pdf container.</li>
  <li>UI::Command class and UI.create_cursor were modified to accept vector format (SVG under Windows, PDF under OSX). Both toolbars and cursors can now accept vector icons.</li>
  <li>Added two methods to assist with debugging extensions. Sketchup.debug_mode= and Sketchup.debug_mode? will allow developers to toggle the display of the following notifications:</li>
  <li>Ruby Console now warns about Ruby operations left open. Leaving operations open is typically a bad practice. We are warning developers that they should try to find a different way of doing what they want to do.</li>
  <li>Ruby Console now warns when a user tries to create a nested operation. Starting a new operation while one is still open is a bad practice. We would like developers to be more aware that they are doing this so that they can fix their code.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-sketchup-2015">What’s new in SketchUp 2015</h2>

<h3 id="renaming-the-plugins-menu">Renaming the Plugins Menu</h3>

<p>We renamed the “Plugins” menu to “Extensions” to be more inline with our current naming conventions. This should not break existing plugins. Adding a menu item to the “Plugins” menu will still work, it will be added to the “Extensions” menu.</p>

<h3 id="new---extension-licensing-api">New! - Extension Licensing API</h3>

</ul>

<h3 id="webdialog-js-error-dialogs-for-developers">Webdialog JS error Dialogs for Developers</h3>

<p>In previous versions of SketchUp on Windows, users would see javascript error popup boxes anytime there was malformed js code on a webpage. We muted those popups in a previous release. Due to popular demand, we have brought them back, this time for developers only! Developers can enable js error popups by creating this key in their Windows registry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/SketchUp/SketchUp 2015/WebDialogs/ShowErrorDialogs and adding a DWORD value set to 1.</p>

<h3 id="bug-fixes-and-improvements">Bug Fixes and Improvements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>We are now setting the initial working directory to the user’s Documents directory.</li>
  <li>Restored $0 to return “SketchUp” as it did prior to SketchUp 2014.</li>
  <li>Fixed bug where point3d.vector_to(inputpoint) would return incorrect result.</li>
  <li>Cleaned up inconsistent operation name and id used in the Edge class.</li>
  <li>Fixed crashes caused by internal calls to Ruby from worker threads.</li>
  <li>Prevented crash when there is an uncaught Ruby error happening in Importer.load_file</li>
  <li>Geom::BoundingBox.corner now raises an IndexError when given an incorrect index.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Geom::BoundingBox.intersect could yield incorrect results.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Geom::BoundingBox.intersect would not accept an array of vertices or boundingboxes.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where Geom::PolygonMesh.normal_at would not return correct vertex normal if the model was modified in the same processing loop as the script obtaining the PolygonMesh.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where a frozen array might raise an error when a method acts on that array, even if the method does not modify the array.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where InputPoint objects could cause a crash in certain circumstances.</li>
  <li>Changed the classifications folder inside the Program Files folder from C:\Program Files (x86)\SketchUp\SketchUp 2015\Classifications to C:\Program Files (x86)\SketchUp\SketchUp 2015\ShippedClassifications. Now Sketchup.find_support_file(“Classifications”) will return the classifications folder in the user folder, instead of in the application folder.</li>
  <li>Setting material during ModelObserver.onPreSave did not work in SU2014. This should be fixed for 2015.</li>
  <li>ViewObserver notification used to fail when in parallel projection. This has been fixed.</li>
  <li>Custom context menus in custom tools have been improved. It is now possible to determine what type of entity was clicked on, before opening the context menu. Therefore custom context menus can be written to handle different types of entities differently.</li>
  <li>Exploding an image entity now returns an array of entities. These include all associated edges, the face, edgeuse objects, etc. Previously it return an empty array.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where view.draw(GL_LINES, …) crashes when passed an odd number of points.</li>
  <li>HTTPS connections should now work on Windows using ‘net/https’.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-sketchup-2014-m1">What’s new in SketchUp 2014 M1</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed a crash that occurred when exporting an animation while any Ruby tool was active.</li>
  <li>Fixed an EntityObserver crash in onEraseEntity that could occur if the observer removed itself.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug in ViewObserver which caused observer methods to not fire properly in certain rare cases. This occurred when an observer was being removed and a new one being added within the same notification loop of another event.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where launching SketchUp by double-clicking a skp file on another drive would corrupt $LOAD_PATH and render the Standard Library inaccessible. This bug caused many people to run into plugin loading problems if they were opening files located on drives other than their “C:” drive.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug on Windows where plugins would not load if the user name contained single quotes.</li>
  <li>Fixed a regression in Face.position_material. Under SketchUp 2014.0.4900 a (caught) exception generated by a failed Face.position_material call appears to cause SketchUp to unwind everything back to the last Model.start_operation.</li>
  <li>Fixed a ruby unicode issue where ruby could not require .so files from unicode paths.</li>
  <li>Added support to SketchUp Mac to load SURubyDebugger.dylib. Developers can now use our debugger on Mac.</li>
  <li>Fixed an issue where the LayersObserver would cause SketchUp to crash when the user would do an undo then a redo.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-sketchup-2014">What’s new in SketchUp 2014</h2>

<p>We have made many additions and improvements to the SketchUp Ruby API. These changes include some big and potentially code-breaking changes in this round of SketchUp. We strongly recommend all developers test their scripts for compatibility with 2014.</p>

  <li>Please read through the langhandler.rb file and the documentation on this website for a better understanding of the LanguageHandler class.</li>
  <li>Group.make_unique is no longer deprecated and the warning has been removed.</li>
  <li>Added persistent IDs for groups and component which can be accessed via Ruby.</li>
  <li>Ruby UI.openpanel/savepanel filters now use a more complex filetype filter to allow for multiple multi-file type filters.</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="ruby-console-upgrades">Ruby Console Upgrades</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Multi line code input and pasting into ruby console on Win (Ctrl+Enter creates a new line)</li>
  <li>Ruby Console writes data to itself much faster and does not slow down after many errors have been written</li>
  <li>Typing cls now also clears the console</li>
  <li>Mac Ruby Console reverted back to fixed width font</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="observer-bug-fixes">Observer Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Fixed AppObserver bug where onNewModel/onOpenModel methods were not being called for models that get created or opened at program startup. See AppObserver API docs for information on how to take advantage of this bug fix.</li>
  <li>Fixed an EntitiesObserver crash that occurred when a group gets created and exploded within the same operation and has an EntitiesObserver attached to it.</li>
  <li>The onSaveModel observer notification on PC is triggered incorrectly when selecting File &gt; Save As and then canceling before saving. This is now fixed.</li>
  <li>Using the same observer to observe multiple entities was causing memory leaks. This should now be fixed.</li>
  <li>AppObserver.onQuit should now fire reliably on Mac</li>
  <li>Observers were not being properly freed after being removed, potentially causing significant performance degradation.</li>
  <li>Fixed a crash when reloading a component and an EntitiesObserver was attached to the model.</li>
  <li>ModelObserver.onExplode now triggers when an instance is exploded via the Ruby API.</li>
  <li>Fixed the EntitiesObserver bug where a wrong Entities reference would be sent to observer methods when observing a group’s Entities.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="moved-the-set-class-to-sketchupset">Moved the Set class to Sketchup::Set</h3>

<p>In order to avoid clashing with the Standard Ruby Library we moved the Set class to Sketchup::Set. All references to the SketchUp Set class should be refactored. See <a href="ourdoc/set">Set</a> class documentation for more information.</p>

<h3 id="general-bug-fixes">General Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Ensured that our classes that implement Enumerable don’t override the improved Ruby 2.0 #count method. Also ensured all Enumerable classes implement #length and #size.</li>
  <li>Updated PolygonMesh API docs to be accurate. Numerous other API documentation fixes and updates.</li>
  <li>Fixed program hang when output is written to the console via puts from within a Ruby 2.0 Thread. These output will no longer hang the program but they also will not be printed. All access to the SU API (including writing to the console) must be made from within the main thread.</li>
  <li>Added argument validation to Layer.page_behaviour and updated API docs.</li>
  <li>Fixed crash when hiding layers while iterating through selected entities. If your code modifies the collection you are iterating during the iteration process, SketchUp will stop iterating. Instead you should iterate over an array of the collection. Code similar to <code>selection.each { |e| code_to_modify_the_selection_set }</code> should be changed to: <code>selection.to_a.each { |e| code_to_modify_the_selection_set }</code> This is true of all collections such as: Entities, Layers, DefinitionList, Pages, Selection, etc.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug where groups that share the same definition would seem to continue to share entities after being made unique in some cases.</li>
  <li>Fixed Group.description= which didn’t make the group unique before setting its description.</li>
  <li>Fixed the erroneous “RangeError: value cannot be negative” that was raised on valid input for ConstructionLine.stipple=</li>
  <li>Fixed DefinitionList.load and load_from_url which did not start Ruby operations properly.</li>
  <li>Fixed crashes and other oddities that would happen when applying a material that wasn’t in the model already - either selected from Material Browser or a material from another open model. Now the material is recreated in the model it is applied to.</li>
  <li>Fixed Entities methods erase_entities and add_3d_text which did not make the group unique when called for a group Entities.</li>
  <li>Ruby references belonging to closed models should no longer remain alive and cause possible crashes on Mac.</li>
  <li>Fixed the crash that occurred when Outliner is open and a group is created/erased within the same operation.</li>
  <li>Fixed Sketchup.active_model.export(‘myFilename.dae’) truncating first two characters when given relative paths.</li>
  <li>Fixed Tools.pop_tool to ensure the last tool cannot be popped, which would leave SketchUp in a state without an active tool.</li>
  <li>Fixed Tools.active_tool_name to return proper tool names on Mac.</li>
  <li>Fixed Model.close_active so the operation appears on the undo stack as it should. Prevents undoing the operation from shifting the geometry.</li>
  <li>Fixed Materials.remove so that it correctly removes the material from the entities in the model before removing it from the materials list.</li>
  <li>Loader files registered to SketchupExtension can now be an encrypted file (.rbs).</li>
  <li>Fixed the inputbox wrapper in sketchup.rb to not enter an infinite loop if no arguments are given.</li>
  <li>Fixed loading errors to be more verbose and include file paths and code line numbers</li>
  <li>Any ruby errors occurring on rbs files are now reported with proper file name and line numbers.</li>
  <li>Ruby keywords +<strong>FILE</strong>+ and +<strong>LINE</strong>+ now work properly within rbs files.</li>
  <li>Ruby errors that occur during program startup are now reported with stack traces, which should make it easier to diagnose problems.</li>
  <li>Fixed a bug on Windows where WebDialog.show did not remember previous size/location of webdialog.</li>
  <li>Sketchup::require did not push paths for loaded rbs files into $LOADED_FEATURES - this is now fixed.</li>
  <li>RBZ extraction should now preserve file permissions.</li>
  <li>Group/ComponentInstance.locked= (true/false) now correctly adds itself to the undo stack.</li>
  <li>Added negative value checks to methods that expect unsigned integer parameters (certain methods that use integers as arguments were allowing poorly formatted negative values).</li>
  <li>ComponentInstance/Group.explode while editing the component that you explode would crash SketchUp. This is now fixed.</li>
  <li>Previously Tool.getInstructorContentDirectory method assumed everything was relative to the SketchUp Resource folder. This has been changed for 2014. Now it accepts absolute paths to either file or folder</li>
  <li>New method: Sketchup.quit</li>
  <li>Added WebDialog.screen_scale_factor which can be useful on Mac retina screens.</li>
  <li>Implemented EntitiesObserver.onActiveSectionPlaneChanged</li>
  <li>Added Geom::PolygonMesh.set_uv(index, uv)</li>
  <li>Fixed the EntitiesObserver bug where a wrong Entities reference would be sent to observer methods when observing a group’s Entities collection.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-sketchup-2013-m1">What’s new in SketchUp 2013 M1</h2>

<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h3>

<p>Fixed a toolbar bug that caused some extensions to not display and become incorrectly docked behind other toolbars. Developers are now advised to call Toolbar.restore after creating a toolbar, although those that do not will also work correctly on SU2013 M1.</p>

<p>Fixed a bug in WebDialog.get_element_value which caused it to malfunction with some html elements on Mac.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-sketchup-2013">What’s new in SketchUp 2013</h2>

<p>LanguageHandler was an existing internal class which we are now exposing in the API. It has been updated such that it looks first for translated resources within the Resources folder in the extension directory structure (as explained in the <a href="http://extensions.sketchup.com/en/developer">Extension Warehouse Developer Center</a>). All translated resources should be located within the appropriate language folder.</p>

<h3 id="added-special-html-link-to-launch-an-extensions-page-on-extension-warehouse">Added special HTML link to launch an extension’s page on Extension Warehouse</h3>

<p>See detailed explanation of the “skp:launchEW” link in WebDialog class documentation.</p>

<h3 id="improved-the-toolbar-class">Improved the toolbar class</h3>

<p>Two new methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Toolbar.name</li>
  <li>Toolbar.each</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixed these failing method calls on Mac:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UI.set_toolbar_visible ‘GoogleToolPaletteController’, false</li>
  <li>UI.set_toolbar_visible ‘ToolPaletteController’, false</li>
  <li>UI.set_toolbar_visible “SolidModelToolPaletteController”, true</li>
  <li>UI.set_toolbar_visible “SolidModelToolPaletteController”, false</li>
</ul>

<p>Fixed this failing method calls on the PC:</p>

<ul>
  <li>UI.set_toolbar_visible “Walkthrough”, true</li>
  <li>UI.set_toolbar_visible “Walkthrough”, false</li>
  <li>UI.set_toolbar_visible “FullToolSet”, true</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="expanded-the-materialmaterials-classes">Expanded the Material/Materials Classes</h3>

<p>New methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Materials.remove</li>
  <li>Material.name=</li>
  <li>Material.write_thumbnail</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gave-ruby-access-to-the-shadow-bug-fix">Gave Ruby Access to the “Shadow Bug Fix”</h3>

<p>If you find yourself in a situation where the 8.0 M1 shadow bug fix is getting unexpected results, you can turn it off.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sketchup.fix_shadow_strings=</li>
  <li>Sketchup.fix_shadow_strings?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="improved-alpha-transparency-control">Improved Alpha Transparency Control</h3>

<ul>
  <li>View.draw2d now respects the alpha set with view.drawing_color</li>
  <li>Color.alpha= nows accept values either between 0.0 and 1.0 or 0 and 255</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixed-several-bugs">Fixed Several Bugs</h3>

<p>We accidentally introduced some bugs with recent SketchUp releases. So we fixed them in 8.0 M1:</p>

<p>View.pickhelper(x,y,aperture) stopped respecting arguments passed to it. This was breaking the Bezier.rb and BZ Tools plugins. Now fixed.</p>

<p>ConstructionLine.stipple= method now works as documented.</p>

<p>Model.raytest method was occasionally returning incorrect values. We fixed that and added an optional boolean argument to specify whether or not to stop at hidden entities:
model.raytest(ray) - ignores entities that are hidden
model.raytest(ray, true) ignores entities that are hidden
model.raytest(ray, false) stops at entities that are hidden (via hide or on hidden layers)</p>

<p>Color.new().to_i was returning a Bignum when a Fixnum was expected. A Fixnum is now returned.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-sketchup-8">What’s new in SketchUp 8</h2>

<h3 id="updated-ruby-version-to-186-on-pc">Updated Ruby Version to 1.8.6 on PC</h3>

<p>The version of the Ruby interpreter that ships with SketchUp has been upgraded to 1.8.6 on PC (still 1.8.5 on Mac). Please note that 1.8.6 includes thousands of bug fixes and stability improvements, but that it also is more strict about syntax. Scripts that work in SketchUp 7.x and earlier may have syntax failures in SketchUp 8.</p>

<h3 id="webdialog-user-agent-updated">WebDialog User Agent Updated</h3>

<p>It used to be that WebDialogs would send a useragent string unique to SketchUp. We now send a useragent that is a concatenation with the embedded browser’s original useragent and an extra string to identity SketchUp. This allows the Google Earth plugin (and similar plugins) to correctly detect the kind of browser so it works properly inside SketchUp.</p>

<h3 id="observer-bug-fixes-1">Observer Bug Fixes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>DefinitionObserver.onComponentInstanceAdded now works.</li>
  <li>DefinitionObserver.onComponentInstanceRemoved now works.</li>
  <li>SelectionObserver.onSelectionAdded now works.</li>

  <li>Fixed InstanceObserver so it works consistently and without crashes.</li>
  <li>MaterialsObserver.onMaterialSetCurrent now works.</li>
  <li>MaterialsObserver.onMaterialUndoRedo now works.</li>
  <li>New method: ModelObserver.onPreSaveModel</li>
  <li>New method: ModelObserver.onPostSaveModel</li>
</ul>

<p>EntitiesObserver.onElementModified now accepts 2 parameters: entities and entity, making it much more useful.</p>

<p>Fixed common crash with EntitiesObserver.onContentsModified Also, EntitiesObserver.onContentsModified renamed to EntitiesObserver.onElementModified for consistency.</p>

<p>The callback MaterialsObserver.onMaterialRemoveAll now deprecated, we recommend using MaterialsObserver.onMaterialRemove instead.</p>

<h3 id="write-image-size-clamped">Write Image Size Clamped</h3>

<p>view.write_image is now clamped to export a maximum image size of 16000x16000 to prevent freezes.</p>

<h3 id="timers-work-in-smaller-increments">Timers Work in Smaller Increments</h3>

<p>UI.start_timer now accepts values less than 1 second.</p>

  <li>outer_shell</li>
  <li>equals?</li>
  <li>show_differences</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="faceclassifypoint-updated">Face.classify_point updated</h3>

<p>Note that the return values for Face.classify_point have changed for SketchUp 8. See the documentation for the list of constants that you should check against. If you have scripts that rely on hard-coded numeric values, you should update them to use constants, instead.</p>

<h3 id="crashes-fixed">Crashes fixed</h3>

<p>Finally, we fixed a number of crashing bugs, mostly related to iterating across entities in the model.</p>

<h2 id="whats-new-in-sketchup-6">What’s new in SketchUp 6</h2>

<p>The most substantial addition to the SketchUp 6 Ruby API are the Ruby Observer Mechanism, the Tools class, the WebDialog class, the Styles class, and the Style class.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-observer-mechanism">Ruby Observer Mechanism</h3>

<p>The Ruby Observer Mechanism is designed to allow Ruby scripts to be notified when objects change in the SketchUp application or model. For example, you can create an observer class that “listens” to when SketchUp quits and then performs some action.</p>

<p>Create a Ruby class of a specific observer type, such as AppObserver, override the desired methods, such as onQuit, and add an instance of the observer to the applicable objects in your Ruby script (using the add_observer method for that object). Refer to individual observer interfaces for further information.</p>

<h3 id="tools-class">Tools Class</h3>

<p>The Tools class contains methods to manipulate a collection of SketchUp tools. This class is primarily used to switch between tools through the use of key or mouse actions.</p>

<h3 id="webdialog-class">WebDialog Class</h3>

<p>The Ruby WebDialog class to create and interact with, DHTML dialog boxes, called webdialogs in this documentation, from Ruby code. For example, you can create webdialogs that are invoked from your Ruby code to display a web site, or to accept user input and use the results in your Ruby code. Styles and Style Classes The Styles class contains methods for manipulating a collection of styles in a model. The Style class contains methods for modifying information about a specific style.</p>

<h2 id="before-sketchup-6">Before SketchUp 6</h2>

<p>The core 62 classes of the API were established here. Very few users are on anything before SketchUp 6, so this documentation site focuses only on SketchUp 6 and up.</p>
